> Create lists of products to display throughout the site or in order to group certain products together. Use Product Lists to build Artist Stores, Sales, Webstore Sections and more!

## Getting Started 
### Located Under Products on the Menu Bar: <br />
Select "Product Lists" at bottom of drop down menu <br />
Or go straight here:  /cms/prod-list<br />
<br />
Select "+ Add" <br />



## Artist Stores

You can use Product Lists to create Artist Stores! By default, the website will create an Artist Store Page at store/artist_name_url. 

**Example: https://keeledscales.com/store/knife_in_the_water**

If you create a new Product List at this same url, it will override it! This is also where you would add a banner image for your artist store. 

## Sales
Create a Product List for each group of sale items. Pick a few price tiers (3-4).For example $15, $20, $25. 

## Webstore Sections

You can create product lists to link to from youre website toolbar drop down. 
**Example: Pre-Orders & New Releases, Featured Products**
