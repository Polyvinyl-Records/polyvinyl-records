# How to Use the Automation Tool:
> Quickly schedule news, tracks, albums, banners, products, bundles and product lists to be ACTIVE or INACTIVE at a set time! 

Before you start &mdash; double check the items you'd like to set active or inactive are updated correctly in the CMS. 

For example: If you want to turn an inactive item active at a certain time, make sure that item is set inactive.

### Name
Internal. Whatever you want! 

**Example:** If this is for an album pre-order with multiple items, you may want to name it by the album release. 

You will be able to place a variety of different items under this one automation to turn off or on at the same time &mdash; such as banner images, news items, products.

### Trigger Time

**Use 5 minute increments when setting time, otherwise will just round up to nearest 5 minute increment.** <br />
<br />

**Example:** To set Trigger Time for ``10:30``, you can enter a time of anywhere from `` 10:30:00`` to ``10:25:01``. Make sure the seconds are set to ``:00``, as ``10:30:01`` would result in rounding up to ``10:35:00``. 

### Active - Setting Items to "Active" 

__Example:__ 
- Pre-order announcement. 

### Inactive - Setting Items to "Inactive" <br />

__Example:__ 
- Making banner, products or product list inactive when a sale ends.
- Making products inactive in future when distribution rights change.
