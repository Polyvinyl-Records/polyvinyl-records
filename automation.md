### Name
Internal &mdash; whatever you want! 

**Example:** If this is for an album pre-order you may want to name it by the album release. You will be able to place a variety of different items under this one automation to turn off or on at the same time &mdash; such as banner images, news items, products.

### Trigger Time
This time will be based on time zone the website is located.<br><br>
Use 5 minute increments when setting time, otherwise will just round up to nearest 5 minute increment. <br />

### Active
The item must already be set at inactive - will not turn an active item inactive. 
Add for each item you would like to include in the automation. <br />
<br />
__Example:__ 
- Pre-order announcement. 

### Inactive <br />
__Example:__ 
- Making products or product list inactive when a sale ends.
- Making products inactive in future when distribution rights change.
