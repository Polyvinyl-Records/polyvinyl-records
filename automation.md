### Name
Internal. Whatever you want! 

**Example:** If this is for an album pre-order with multiple items, you may want to name it by the album release. You will be able to place a variety of different items under this one automation to turn off or on at the same time &mdash; such as banner images, news items, products.

### Trigger Time
This time will be based on time zone the website is located.<br><br>
**Use 5 minute increments when setting time, otherwise will just round up to nearest 5 minute increment.** <br />
<br />

**Example:** To set Trigger Time for ``10:30``, you can enter a time of anywhere from `` 10:30:00`` to ``10:25:01``. Make sure the seconds are set to ``:00``, as ``10:30:01`` would result in rounding up to ``10:35:00``. 

### Active - Settings things to "Active"
The item must already be set at inactive in the CMS - the automator will not turn an active item inactive. 

__Example:__ 
- Pre-order announcement. 

### Inactive - Setting things to "Inactive" <br />
__Example:__ 
- Making banner, products or product list inactive when a sale ends.
- Making products inactive in future when distribution rights change.
