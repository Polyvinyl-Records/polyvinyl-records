# How to Schedule a Sale
> Bulk update sale prices and determine length of sale. 

## Getting Started
### [Product Lists:](product_lists.md)
Before you even create a new sale &mdash; the first step is to create a [**Product List**](product_lists.md) to group the sale items. We would recommend picking a few price tiers to group products into.

**Example** $15, $20, $25 or 10%, 15%, 30% off. 
### Located Under Products on the Menu Bar: <br />
Select "Sale" at bottom of drop down menu <br />
Or go straight here:  /cms/sale<br />
Select **+ Add** <br />

Add Sale Name. **The name you choose will be visible to customers on the product page:**

Next, select a Start Date & End Date

Adjust Status to "Active" or "Inactive". If you've selected a future Start Date or want the sale to start right away, you can select Active and it will turn o n at the selected Start Date time.  

Select "Type" from the drop down options: 

- Percent Off
- Flat Price 
- Buy X get Y Free 
- Free Item with Purchase

Based on the type you can put in the next Value

**Example: if you select Flat Price you would add in $10.**

Affected Items: 
select the Product List you built in the previous step above.

**Please note, if a product instance has 0 inventory it will NOT show up on this view** 
If you notice an item is not showing on this view that should be search for it in Product Instances and make sure the stock is more than 0 and the product is marked Active.
