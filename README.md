## Editing - Edit View &amp; Info View {docsify-ignore}

Once you've added a new Artist, Album, Product or Instance there are two places to edit content &amp; features &mdash; the **Edit View** and the **Info View**.

### Edit View
Controls basic elements such as Name, Sort Name, and URL. <br>
The **edit view** is located by clicking the pencil icon or the "edit" button.

### Info View
Controls more details and optional features, such as an Artist's photo, featured products, social media links, contacts and other data that is only accessible from this screen.<br><br>
The **info view** is displayed after clicking on the Artist name link once you have created an Artist. In this example below we created an Artists, Julie Byrne, and then clicked the link which was located under the name column.
