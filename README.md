### Welcome to the Dispatch Dept. Help Center!

We've compiled some helpful tips here for utilizing all the features of the Dispatch Dept. platform using the CMS. 

See below for a brief overview of how to navigate the CMS.

> The CMS is organized by: <br>
> **[Artist](artist_page.md)** > **[Album](album.md)** > **[Product](product.md)** > **[Instances](instances.md)**:

### Edit View
Each Artist, Album, Product, or Instance has two places to add information &mdash; the **edit view** and the **info** or **details view**.

The edit view is located by clicking the pencil icon or the "edit" button from the info/ details view screen.
``/cms/albums``

### Info View
The details or info view is displayed after clicking on the link once you have created an Album, Artist, Product, or Instance. 

In this example above we created an Artists, Julie Byrne, and then clicked the link which was located under the name column. 

Here we can edit featured products, social media links, contacts and other data that is only accessible from this screen: 

``/cms/albums/info``
